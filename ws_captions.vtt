caption 1
00:01.000 --> 00:04.000 
We observe today

caption 2
00:04.000 --> 00:06.000 
not a victory of party,

caption 3
00:06.000 --> 00:10.000 
but a celebration of freedom –

caption 4
00:10.000 --> 00:12.000 
symbolizing an end,

caption 5
00:12.000 --> 00:15.000 
as well as a beginning –

caption 6
00:15.000 --> 00:17.000 
signifying renewal,

caption 7
00:17.000 --> 00:19.000 
as well as change.

caption 8
00:19.000 --> 00:22.000 
For I have sworn before you

caption 9
00:22.000 --> 00:24.000 
and Almighty God

caption 10
00:24.000 --> 00:27.000 
the same solemn oath

caption 11
00:27.000 --> 00:30.000 
our forebears prescribed

caption 12
00:30.000 --> 00:33.000 
nearly a century and three-quarters ago.
